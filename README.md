# pebble-rangefinder

A simple pebble app to measure distances.
Wait a little bit until the gps is accurate enough (+- 5 to 15m), press the select button to record your current location... and the app will display the distance to this point.

This app uses your phone GPS, so it's measuring the distance from your phone to your phone recorded location

And this is a pebble.js app, running on your phone... so it's not power efficient, and it's a first time prototype written in a few hours... so really not power efficient.
